# Hunt MMR Reader
## What is this?
I made this tool for the game **Hunt: Showdown**. In this game you have some kind of rank that is represented by stars. The ranking goes from 1 to 6 stars, where 1 is the lowest and 6 is the best. These stars are bound to a number.\
The specific rank ranges are as follows:
| MMR range | Stars |
|:---------:|:-----:|
|   0-1999  |   ★   |
| 2000-2299 |   ★★   |
| 2300-2599 |   ★★★   |
| 2600-2749 |   ★★★★   |
| 2750-2999 |   ★★★★★   |
| >= 3000   |   ★★★★★★   |\

## To be noted
- The program automatically detects if the file was modified and reads it on changes.
- Hitting **F5** forces the program to read the file.
## Can I get VAC ban or game ban for using this?
This program just reads a file. You can achieve the same with any text editor. I would say it's very unlikely to get banned for this, but at the end it is up to the **Hunt: Showdown developers** to decide who should get banned. **I'm not liable for any damage caused by this software and I'm not guaranteeing anything. In the end it is up to you and it's your risk to use this software.**
